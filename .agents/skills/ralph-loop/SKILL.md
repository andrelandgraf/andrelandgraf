# Ralph Loop

Complete setup for automated agent-driven development. Define features as user stories with testable acceptance criteria, then run AI agents in a loop until all stories pass.

## Prerequisites

Complete these recipes first (in order):

### AI Coding Agent Configuration

Configure AI coding agents like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, or Claude Code with project-specific patterns, coding guidelines, and MCP servers for consistent AI-assisted development.

```bash
curl -H "Accept: text/markdown" https://fullstackrecipes.com/api/recipes/agent-setup
```

## Cookbook - Complete These Recipes in Order

### User Stories Setup

Create a structured format for documenting feature requirements as user stories. JSON files with testable acceptance criteria that AI agents can verify and track.

```bash
curl -H "Accept: text/markdown" https://fullstackrecipes.com/api/recipes/user-stories-setup
```

### Working with User Stories

Document and track feature implementation with user stories. Workflow for authoring stories, building features, and marking acceptance criteria as passing.

```bash
curl -H "Accept: text/markdown" https://fullstackrecipes.com/api/recipes/using-user-stories
```

### Ralph Agent Loop

Set up automated agent-driven development with Ralph. Run AI agents in a loop to implement features from user stories, verify acceptance criteria, and log progress for the next agent.

```bash
curl -H "Accept: text/markdown" https://fullstackrecipes.com/api/recipes/ralph-setup
```
