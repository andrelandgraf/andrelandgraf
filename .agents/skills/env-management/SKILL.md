# Environment Variable Management

Complete environment variable management with type-safe validation, Vercel dev workflow, and prebuild validation.

## Cookbook - Complete These Recipes in Order

### Type-Safe Environment Configuration

Type-safe environment variable validation using Zod with a Drizzle-like schema API. Supports server/public fields, feature flags, either-or constraints, and client-side protection.

```bash
curl -H "Accept: text/markdown" https://fullstackrecipes.com/api/recipes/config-schema-setup
```

### Environment Variable Management with Vercel

Manage environment variables across Vercel environments. Sync with Vercel CLI, handle local overrides, and load env vars in scripts.

```bash
curl -H "Accept: text/markdown" https://fullstackrecipes.com/api/recipes/env-workflow-vercel
```

### Build-Time Environment Variable Validation

Validate environment variables on server start and before builds. Catch missing or invalid variables early with clear error messages.

```bash
curl -H "Accept: text/markdown" https://fullstackrecipes.com/api/recipes/env-validation
```
