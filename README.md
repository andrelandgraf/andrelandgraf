## About me

My name is Andre and I love to develop web and voice applications! I am a huge Marvel fan 🦸‍♂️ and like to spent my evenings binge watching Big Bang Theory. My collegues know me as the React enthusiast. I listen to Blinding Lights at least once a day and my car only knows [Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm/).

## Repositories

In the following, you can find a description to most of my public GitHub repositories. Feel free to get inspired, reuse my code, and please provide feedback or contribution if you are interested in any of the projects!

### Open source packages

Following repositories are also available on npm!

#### react-datalist-input

My first ever npm package! I created react-datalist-input both to learn more about packaging on npm and to fit my own dropdown use cases. Over time, I have constantly updated the package based on my own changing use cases and feedback. You can find the package [here on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-datalist-input). 🚀

=> [react-datalist-input](https://github.com/andrelandgraf/react-datalist-input)

#### react-plain-datalist-input

A non-styled version of react-datalist-input. When I created react-datalist-input, I bundled a css file with it. The plain version comes without the css file and does support server-side-rendering and static-site-generation. You can find the package [here on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-plain-datalist-input). 🚀

#### react-ssml-dom

I love voice UIs 💜. I believe that voice will only become more prominent over time. However, today's voice UI and speech sdks are vendor-dependent and provide more an interface to platform APIs than tools to build sophisticated UIs. Amazon developers build lambda functions and use the Alexa Console while Google Assistant developers develop on Dialogflow or Actions on Google and use different sdks. react-ssml-dom is a research project that aims to take advantage of React and its component-based UI development for voice UIs. It also provides a middleware engine to parse any request from any vendor to a unified runtime payload and then revert back the response to the vendor-based response JSON. You can find the package [here on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-ssml-dom). I wrote more about my motivation [here on Medium.com](https://andre-timo-landgraf.medium.com/a-react-renderer-for-ssml-91cdd1d66b3e). 👀

### portfolio

The following repositories are skeleton apps, portfolio projects, and university exercises, I built over time.

#### Gatsby-x

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/8b147a7f-5070-444b-b0c4-6149376f2c5d/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/gatsbyx/deploys)

I started using Gatsby in the beginning of 2020. I developed my first real-world project - velapilates - using the framework. I learned a lot over time about styling, theming, a11y, and more. Gatsby-X was my first run at creating my own design system. It implements a full-fetched online store with OAuth 2 user logic, purchasing, animations, and reusable UI components.

This is both a portfolio project and a work-in-progress attempt to create a skeleton app for future sites. Please feel free to use my code!

=> Storybook 📖: [Gatsby-X design-system](https://design-system.andre-landgraf.cool/)

#### Foodo

My favorite university project. Foodo - a recipe optimization application and your ultimate health buddy - really improved my React and web development skills. It consists of a React frontend, Express.js backend, and an Alexa skill. The Alexa skill requires account linking which we implemented from scratch using our own OAuth 2 implementation! We were a team of five students and spent a whole semester to create Foodo and I could not be prouder! 🤓

#### andrelandgraf

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/8a32237e-e6d6-4567-aaf0-e518810a1061/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/andre-landgraf/deploys)

My personal website! It is produly hosted on my favorite hosting platform - Netlify! 💚

It uses React and Gatby and also includes the README.md that you are currently reading!

=> Website: [andre-landgraf.dev](https://www.andre-landgraf.dev)

#### covid-stats-SSML

Unfortunately, both Google and Alexa do not allow third-party information about covid on their voice platforms. I created covid-stats-ssml as a demo app to try out react-ssml-dom! Covid-stats-ssml is a React-rendered voice application! 🚀

=> [covid-stats-ssml](https://github.com/andrelandgraf/covid-stats-ssml)

#### Leetcode

A collection of leetcode exercises from Leetcode.com. It's both fun and exercise for me!

=> [leetcode](https://github.com/andrelandgraf/leetcode)

#### react-oauth2-skeleton

A small skeleton application that uses a self-made OAuth 2 flow. Feel free to copy this code if you want to get rid of passport.js or want to work around with MongoDB, Express.js, React, and your custom OAuth 2 flow!

=> Frontend: [react-oauth2-skeleton](https://github.com/andrelandgraf/react-oauth2-skeleton)
=> Backend: [express-oauth2-skeleton](https://github.com/andreweinkoetz/express-oauth2-skeleton)

#### High-5-Learning

How I got introduced to React and met my best friends from Munich 💜. High-5-Learning is the result of a seminar project at the second semester of my master's degree. A teacher-student application that allows the creation of single-choice exercises, student invitations, exercise feedback for students, and resulting stats for the teachers.

=> Frontend: [high5-learning-frontend](https://github.com/andreweinkoetz/high5-learning-frontend)
=> Backend: [high5-learning-backend](https://github.com/andrelandgraf/high5-learning-backend)

#### web-snippets

Just some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript exercises.

=> [web-snippets](https://github.com/andrelandgraf/web-snippets)

#### laravel-docker

Super outdated. A laravel docker skeleton application that I built at my first working student position.

=> [laravel-docker](https://github.com/andrelandgraf/laravel-docker)

#### Discrete Structures

Some exercises that helped me prepare for my exam in discrete structures.
