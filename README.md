## About me

I am a web dev from Germany with master degrees in Information Systems and Computer Science. I am located in the Bay Area, CA, and I am working as a Software Engineer at LinkedIn! I love learning, writing, and speaking about all things web. I am also super interested in home automation and voice UI design. In my free time, I tutor up-and-coming developers, attend and organize tech meetups, and build cool web apps.
