## Projects

- Cleaned up react-ssml-dom and published the changes as 2.0.0-experimental.1!
  - I removed the "conversation" logic but I haven't found a great alternative yet.
  - Since I removed the "conversation" logic, the demo app is currently broken.

## Learning

- Investigated React's upcoming Server Components. They seemed like a great replacement to the "conversation" logic in react-ssml-dom but they seem to be quite a bit more complicated. I will probably just use data fetching outside of React for now and then use Remix for the more complex demos.
