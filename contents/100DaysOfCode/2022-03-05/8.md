title: Voice UIs
description: I have been dreaming about using React to develop voice UIs (VUIs) for a long time. In the next weeks, I want to experiment using react-ssml-dom together with Remix!

## Learning

- Played around with [Remix](remix.run) for voice UIs. Spent a lot of time experimenting with the `entry.server.ts` file. Tried to make Remix work both for voice only and ended up integrating voice UI support into a normal Remix web app. I will create a demo for both in the next weeks!

## Projects

- I read through the code of an old research project of mine: react-ssml-dom, which I will use under the hood of my Remix-based voice UIs.
